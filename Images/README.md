This is images that I used in my paper, the paper is unpublished, the TGRS reviewers said it is kind of similar with my previous work, but I just think they know nothing, Angry!
But I think another reason they are right, this paper only used the basic GAN, and actaully the performanc is not very outstanding.

In the next step, I will try to use different architecture, such as pixel-level GAN, Siamese architecture, those netowrks maybe better.
