task:  try to evaluate the quality of the images for 2-direction jitter detetion.
some image have simliay patterns aftern deformed, which means the jitter is hard 
to detect from deformed images. some have obvious deformed edges which will be 
helpful for jitter detection.
input: traditional ways or neural network ways.
neural network way is better.
jitter
